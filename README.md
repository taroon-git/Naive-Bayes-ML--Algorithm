# Naive-Bayes-ML--Algorithm
Pure Implementation of Naive Bayes classification


Bayes' Theorem:
Bayes' theorem is the foundation of Naive Bayes algorithm. It calculates the posterior probability of a class given the features,
based on the prior probability and the likelihood of the features.

P(y | X) = (P(X | y) * P(y)) / P(X)

Where:

P(y | X) is the posterior probability of class y given features X.
P(X | y) is the likelihood, i.e., the probability of features X given class y.
P(y) is the prior probability of class y.
P(X) is the probability of features X.
